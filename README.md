My bachelor thesis, including datasets

Between September 2012 and June 2013 8 fellow students and I worked on a research project for our joint bachelor thesis. The study deals with legitimation processes in political communication and their reflection through the media. We examined the discourse on the basis of the Afghanistan mission of the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) between 2001 and 2012.

All datasets have been evaluated and visualized with SPSS.
